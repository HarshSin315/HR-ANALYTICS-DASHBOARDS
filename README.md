Key Capabilities of an HR Dashboard
The best HR dashboards do much more than KPI tracking and data visualization. Here are key capabilities to keep in mind as you find the right HR dashboard tool for you:

Fully interactive. Leverage powerful HR data analytics directly on the dashboard itself to explore and analyze data.

All data sources. Easily combine and analyze data from all people analytics systems and apps: HCM, payroll, compliance, recruiting, learning, LOB and more.

Augmented Analytics (AI). One of the top 10 BI and data trends this year, modern dashboards are now highly contextualized with AI and alerting. And they’re becoming highly collaborative, maturing into a hub that catalogs insights and distributed data.

Automated Alerts and Reporting. Set up your HR dashboard to be automatically shared with key stakeholders on a regular basis and to send you alerts based on KPIs.

Built for Mobile. Dig into your dashboards with full interactive cloud analytics functionality and touch screen optimization from any device.

Simple Data Prep. An interactive HR dashboard that’s part of a modern people analytics platform will let you spend less time preparing data and more time identifying ways to better manage staffing, development, compensation, safety and health, and employee and labor relations.
